String Decryption

- stack strings are passed to a decryption function
- the decryption function does not contain the typical XOR, but arithmetic (shifts, mul, div, add)

example: C2 address

```c
  local_198 = ZEXT816(0);
  local_188._0_12_ = ZEXT812(0);
  uStack_110 = 0x65;
--- SNIP ---
  uStack_10c = 0x2a;
  local_1c8 = param_1;
                    /* subreviews[.]azurewebsites[.]net */
  pcVar8 = FUN_140011f40(local_198);
```

part of the decryption routine

```c
--- SNIP ---
  iVar1 = ((0x3a - *(int *)(param_1 + 0x20)) * 0x27) % 0x7f + 0x7f;
  *param_1 = (char)iVar1 +
             (((char)(iVar1 / 0x7f) + (char)(iVar1 >> 0x1f)) -
             (char)((longlong)iVar1 * 0x81020409 >> 0x3f)) * -0x7f;
  iVar1 = ((0x3a - *(int *)(param_1 + 0x24)) * 0x27) % 0x7f + 0x7f;
  param_1[1] = (char)iVar1 +
               (((char)(iVar1 / 0x7f) + (char)(iVar1 >> 0x1f)) -
               (char)((longlong)iVar1 * 0x81020409 >> 0x3f)) * -0x7f;
  iVar1 = ((0x3a - *(int *)(param_1 + 0x28)) * 0x27) % 0x7f + 0x7f;
  param_1[2] = (char)iVar1 +
--- SNIP ---
```

built an emulator to decrypt, use the address where stack-string building sstarts, pass to emulator to run the decryption function. The start address is always the `XOR EAX,EAX` before the stack string is assembled.
